## Aim
To design a safe, functional, and durable reinforced concrete (RC) staircase for a building, considering user comfort, structural integrity, and code requirements

## Objectives
- Understand the principles and guidelines governing the design of staircases, including building codes, safety regulations, and architectural considerations
- Calculate the dimensions of the staircase components, including risers, treads, and landing areas, to ensure comfortable and safe usage for occupants
- load calculations to verify the stability and load-bearing capacity of the staircase under anticipated usage conditions
- Prepare detailed construction drawings and specifications that clearly communicate the design intent and requirements to contractors and construction teams

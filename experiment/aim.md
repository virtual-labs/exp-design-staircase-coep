### Aim
To design a safe, functional, and durable reinforced concrete (RC) staircase for a building, considering user comfort, structural integrity, and code requirements

### Objectives
1) Understand the principles and guidelines governing the design of staircases, including building codes, safety regulations, and architectural considerations
2) Calculate the dimensions of the staircase components, including risers, treads, and landing areas, to ensure comfortable and safe usage for occupants
3) load calculations to verify the stability and load-bearing capacity of the staircase under anticipated usage conditions
4) Prepare detailed construction drawings and specifications that clearly communicate the design intent and requirements to contractors and construction teams
